# BasicConsoleProgressBar

## A Basic Progress Bar for Loading Progress in Console Applications

The goal of this repository is to provide a basic, customizeable, console Progress Bar for use in projects involving loops where you wish to visually display the percentage of completion.
This repository provides two Progress Bar Types: ProgressBar and BackgroundProgressBar. The ProgressBar uses 100 character symbols in order to display the level of completion. The BackgroundProgressBar uses the same exact backing symbol that is unchangeable and goes across the entire console width as the percentage values go from 0 to 100.

The ProgressBar remains customizeable in a variety of ways (The BackgroundProgress Bar has the same customizeable options aside from character selection):

1. Most Basic Setup (LowerBound a.k.a current value, UpperBound a.k.a. maximum value)
